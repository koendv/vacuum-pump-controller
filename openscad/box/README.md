# Box

Box for vacuum pump controller. Print the files [box_top.stl](box_top.stl) and [box_bottom.stl](box_bottom.stl). Ream the screw holes with an M3 wood drill. You can ream by hand: put the drill in a vise, and rotate the workpiece once or twice until the inside of the hole is smooth. Use nylon M3 screws and nuts to join controller pcb, box top and bottom. Snip off screws that are too long.

Small differences exist between different displays. The oled display used has these dimensions:
